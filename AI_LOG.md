# AI Usage Log – Project Exam 2 (Holidaze)

Tool used: ChatGPT

This document outlines the limited AI assistance used during this project, in accordance with the assignment AI policy.

All application logic, React components, API integration, booking validation, state handling, and conditional rendering were written independently by me. I can explain all code in this project line by line.


---

## 1. Concept Clarification

AI was occasionally used to:

- Clarify general JavaScript and React concepts
- Discuss ISO date formatting
- Talk through structural decisions at a conceptual level

No production code was generated or copied from AI.


---

## 2. Documentation Support

AI was used to:

- Help structure the AI log
- Refine wording in parts of documentation when needed

All documentation was reviewed and edited by me before submission.


---

## 3. Code Comments

The majority of code comments in this project were written independently by me to explain my own logic and structure.


---

## What AI Was NOT Used For

AI was NOT used to:

- Generate components
- Write async/await logic
- Implement useEffect or useState handling
- Implement booking overlap validation
- Write authentication logic
- Build API request functions
- Configure deployment

All functionality was implemented independently.

## Reflection on AI Use

AI was used strictly as a supplementary learning and documentation aid, in alignment with the assignment’s AI policy.

All core implementation, logic, and problem-solving were completed independently.

I am able to explain all parts of this project if required.
