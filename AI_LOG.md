# AI Usage Log – Project Exam 2 (Holidaze)

Tool used: ChatGPT

This document outlines the limited AI assistance used during this project, in accordance with the assignment AI policy.

All application logic, React components, API integration, booking validation, state handling, and conditional rendering were written independently by me. I can explain all code in this project line by line.


---

## 1. Concept Clarification

AI was occasionally used to:

- Clarify general JavaScript and React concepts
- Discuss ISO date formatting
- Talk through structural decisions at a conceptual level

No production code was generated or copied from AI.


---

## 2. Documentation Support

AI was used to:

- Help structure the AI log
- Refine wording in parts of documentation when needed

All documentation was reviewed and edited by me before submission.


---

## 3. Code Comments

The majority of code comments in this project were written independently by me to explain my own logic and structure.


---

## 4. Figma Documentation 

All Figma design work and the style guide were created independently by me.
AI was used to help phrase a small number of explanatory comments in the Figma file where I needed assistance articulating design decisions.


---

## 3. Kanban/roadmap structuring

AI was used to help structure the Kanban board and roadmap planning, including discussing task breakdown and estimating reasonable time allocations.


---

## What AI Was NOT Used For

AI was NOT used to:

- Generate components
- Write async/await logic
- Implement useEffect or useState handling
- Implement booking overlap validation
- Write authentication logic
- Build API request functions
- Configure deployment

GitHub Copilot was disabled for the entirety of this project.

All functionality was implemented independently.


---

## Reflection on AI Use

AI was used strictly as a supplementary learning and documentation aid, in alignment with the assignment’s AI policy.

All core implementation, logic, and problem-solving were completed independently.

I am able to explain all parts of this project if required.
